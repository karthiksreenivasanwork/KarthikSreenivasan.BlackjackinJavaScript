## Game Rules

- The goal of the Blackjack game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21 points.
- Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
- Each player starts with two cards, and one of the dealer's cards stays hidden until the end.
- To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
- If you go over 21 points, you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
- If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you have hit the Blackjack.
